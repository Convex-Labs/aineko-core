??? info "What is Aineko?"
    Under the hood, Aineko automatically configures tooling needed for production-ready data apps, like message brokers, distributed compute, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration and infrastructure.

## Main Features

| Powerful Pipelines | |
| --- | --- |
| **Quick to Code** | Increase speed to develop applications by 100% to 200%.* |
| **Intuitive** | Codified best practices. Less time reading docs. Less time debugging. |
| **Robust** | Production-ready from the get-go. Scale with ease. |
| |
| **Flexible Nodes**  | |
| **Composable** | Reuse nodes you've built. Reuse python code. Save time by *not* re-inventing the wheel. |
| **Stateful** | Work with simple logic. Work with complex logic. Aineko supports it all. |
| **Code Faster** | Skip the boring stuff with pre-built nodes that work with popular data sources like REST APIs. |
| |
| **Delightful Datasets** || |
| **Fast** | Achieve microsecond latency between nodes.* |
| **Scalable** | Process billions or records per day with ease.* |
| **Governance** | Easily work with different versions of data across pipelines and environments. |

*Estimate based on development experience by an internal team.
