**Aineko is a Python framework for building powerful data applications, limited only by your imagination!**

[Build an Application &ensp; â†’](./quickstart.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary } &ensp; in minutes

With Aineko, you seamlessly bring data into any product and iterate quickly. Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Aineko helps you rapidly build scalable, maintainable, and fast data applications.

Focus on **transformations and business logic**, leave the rest to Aineko.

!!! info
    Under the hood, Aineko automatically configures tooling needed for production-ready data apps, like message brokers, distributed compute, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration and infrastructure.


## Main Features

| Powerful Pipelines | |
| --- | --- |

| **Intuitive** | Codified best practices. Less time reading docs. Less time debugging. |
| **Robust** | Production-ready from the get-go. Scale with ease. |
| |
| **Flexible Nodes**  | |
| **Composable** | Reuse nodes you've built. Reuse python code. Save time by *not* re-inventing the wheel. |
| **Stateful** | Work with simple logic. Work with complex logic. Aineko supports it all. |
| **Code Faster** | Skip the boring stuff with pre-built nodes that work with popular data sources like REST APIs. |
